## D.3 Some additional control statements in Python

### While-loops

The while-loop is a close cousin of the for-loop. In most cases, what you can do with
one of them, you can also do with the other. The point is that in most situations,
one of them will usually be much easier to use than the other.

**Example D.38 (Partial sums with a while-loop)**  
The following code computes the sum
$$\sum_{n=1}^{10} \frac{1}{n} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \cdots + \frac{1}{10}.$$

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
S = 0
n = 1
while n <= 10:
    S = S + 1 / n
    n = n + 1

print(S)
```

Explanation:

1. We initialize `S` and `n`.
2. The loop continues while `n <= 10`.
3. We must update `n` manually inside the loop.

**Remark D.39 (Logical operators)**  
In the above example, we used `<=`. The logical operators `>=`, `==`, and `!=` are
also useful. Note that `==` checks equality and `!=` checks inequality.

### Exercise D.40

Use a while-loop to check how large `n` has to be for the partial sums
$$S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{2^k}$$
to be closer to `2` than `1/10000`.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: find the smallest n such that 2 - S_n < 1/10000.
```

### If-else statements

Alongside for- and while-loops, the if-else statement is the most important tool in
programming.

**Example D.41 (if-statements in Python)**

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
a = 10

if a >= 3:
    print("a is a BIG number")
else:
    print("a is a tiny number")
```

If you want to add more conditions, you can use `elif` and combine conditions using
`and` or `or`.

**Example D.42**

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
a = 10

if a >= 3:
    print("a is a BIG number")
elif a > -3 and a < 3:
    print("a is a tiny number")
elif a <= -3:
    print("a is a BIG but negative number")
```

### Exercise D.43

Use an if-type statement to modify the code from Example D.31 (Fibonacci numbers)
so that `1th`, `2th`, and `3th` are replaced by `1st`, `2nd`, and `3rd`.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: implement the suffix fix inside a loop that prints Fibonacci numbers.
```

### The break command

The `break` command tells Python to stop the nearest loop and to continue the program
on the first unindented line below it.

**Example D.44**  
The following code does exactly the same as the one in Example D.38.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
S = 0
for n in range(1, 1000):
    if n > 10:
        break
    S = S + 1 / n

print(S)
```

**Remark D.45**  
If you have nested loops, `break` only stops the inner-most loop.

### Exercise D.46

Consider the list:

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
my_list = [n / (1 + n**2) for n in range(0, 10**6)]
```

1. Write a code that combines a for-loop with the break command to check when the
   first entry in the list is smaller than `1e-4`.
2. Do the same as in (1), but with a while-loop and no break command.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: implement part (a) with break.
```

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: implement part (b) with a while-loop.
```
